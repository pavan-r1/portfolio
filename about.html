        Hello! I'm <strong>Pavan R</strong>, a passionate and motivated <strong>Data Science student</strong> currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree at T. John Institute of Technology. My journey in the tech world began with a strong interest in problem-solving and understanding how data can drive meaningful change.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked on real-world projects such as building dashboards, fraud detection systems, and opportunity analytics as part of internships and hackathons. I continuously seek to improve my skills in Python, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™ve successfully participated in the <strong>Smart India Hackathon</strong> and contributed to platforms like <strong>Excelerate</strong> during my internship where I helped build data dashboards for leadership decision-making.
      </p>

      <p>
        My core strengths include:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Programming: Python, R, C</li>
        <li>Tools: Excel, Google Sheets, Power BI, Tableau</li>
        <li>Skills: Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, Machine Learning (Basics)</li>
        <li>Soft Skills: Communication, Teamwork, Curiosity, Leadership</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I'm actively looking for opportunities to work on impactful projects and collaborate with teams that are focused on innovation and solving real-world problems with data.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my free time, I love learning new AI tools, exploring open datasets, and sharing knowledge with my peers.
